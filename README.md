# Reading List App
Welcome and thank you for your interest in joining our frontend engineering team at Stylindex! We ask all candidates to complete this unattended front end recruitment test to help us evaluate suitability for the roles we are recruiting for. As a general guide we suggest spending around 2 hours to complete this excercise. We are not looking for perfection and we appreciate that your time is valuable. We are much more interested in the decisions you make and what you choose to prioritise, and you will have the opportunity to discuss your solution in the next stage of recruitment. 

## The Challenge
Create an application to display a recommended reading list using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) and any suitable libraries (we use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react), [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass))

### Acceptance Criteria
* Retrieve data from `https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/styl-reading-list/data.json`
* Display the reading list as 
    - Book title
    - Author name
    - Cover image (thumbnail size)
    - 'More information' link
* Clicking on the 'More information' link should open a single page showing
    - Book title
    - Author name
    - ISBN
    - Cover image (full size)
    - List of books by the same Author (with links)
    - 'Back to list' link

### Requirements
A good solution will
* satisfy the acceptance criteria
* be production ready
* work on evergreen browsers
* have good test coverage
* have a functional user experience and design
* use _appropriate_ front end tooling

Please put your solution on a repository hosting service such as [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) and don't forget the README file for your solution :)
