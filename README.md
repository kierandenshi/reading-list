# Reading List App
Hello! Thank you for your interest in joining our front end engineering team at Stylindex :)

We ask all candidates to complete this short exercise to help us evaluate their suitability for the roles we are recruiting for. As a general guide we suggest spending around 2 hours to complete this excercise. We are not looking for perfection as we are much more interested in the decisions you make and what you choose to prioritise (and we appreciate that your time is very valuable). You will have the opportunity to discuss your solution at the next stage of the recruitment process. 

## The Excercise
Create an application to display a recommended reading list using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) and any suitable libraries (we use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react), [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass))

### Acceptance Criteria
* Retrieve data from `https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/styl-reading-list/data.json`
* Display the list of books on a page, each book item showing
    - Book title
    - Author name
    - Cover image (thumbnail size)
    - 'More information' link
* Clicking on the 'More information' link should open another page showing
    - Book title
    - Author name
    - ISBN
    - Cover image (full size)
    - A list of book titles by the same Author (with links)
    - 'Back to list' link

### Requirements
A good solution will
* satisfy the acceptance criteria
* be production ready
* work on evergreen browsers
* have good test coverage
* have a functional user experience and design
* use _appropriate_ front end tooling

Please put your solution on a repository hosting service such as [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) and don't forget to include a README file for your solution :)
