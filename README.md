# Reading List App
Hello! Thank you for your interest in joining our front end engineering team at Teamed! :)

We ask all candidates to complete this short exercise to help us evaluate their suitability for the roles we are recruiting for. We recommend spending between 2 and 4 hours. You will have an opportunity to discuss your solution, and the choices you made at the next interview stage.

## The Exercise
Create an application to display a recommended reading list using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) and any suitable libraries (we use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react), [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), [RxJS](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs), [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) and [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)). You may use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap your application.

### Acceptance Criteria
* Fetch data from `https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/styl-reading-list/data.json`
* Display the list of books on a page, each book item showing
    - Book title
    - Author name
    - Cover image (thumbnail size)
    - 'More information' link
* Clicking on the 'More information' link should open another page showing
    - Book title
    - Author name
    - ISBN
    - Cover image (full size)
    - A list of book titles by the same Author (with links)
    - 'Back to list' link

### Requirements
A good solution will
* satisfy the acceptance criteria
* work on common web browsers
* have good test coverage
* have a functional user experience and design
* use _appropriate_ front end libraries
* be production ready

Please put your solution on a repository hosting service such as [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) and don't forget to include a README file to tell us how to build and run the application :)
